# About Trailblazer
Amidst the concerning decline in teenage female athletic participation and the scarcity of female coaches in sports, there's a pressing need for innovative solutions. Trailblazer is an educational app that aims to motivate girls to participate and remain in sports. The Athlete tab highlights successful female athletes across time, while the Sports tab showcases male-dominated and lesser-known sports. The Gear tab introduces essential sports equipment to support girls in their athletic journey. 

I had always been an athletic individual, participating in sports like basketball and volleyball growing up. However, after my freshman year, I decided to step away from competitive sports to pursue the robotics team, which allowed me to discover my interest in coding. Recently, I discovered the sport of ultimate, enabling me to compete on a team for the first time in many years. 

Faced with the Swift Student Challenge, I began to reflect on areas of my life for potential problems that I could hope to solve, and was reminded of how I missed playing competitive sports all these years. Upon further research, I learned that the issue around female sports today is not a lack of participation, but is an issue of retention in their teenage years due to social stigma or pubescent changes. This led me to develop Trailblazer, an app aimed at inspiring girls through athlete showcases, exposure to diverse sports, and insights into essential equipment.

This project symbolizes a full-circle journey for me. Had I not left competitive sports, I might not have delved into coding. Reconnecting with my competitive spirit, I aspire to empower young female athletes to persevere in sports through Trailblazer.

# Technologies Used 
For brainstorming, Figma was foundational in designing UI/UX and creating mockups. Development was conducted on Xcode in Swift, with GitHub integration for tracking progress. Learning Swift primarily from YouTube and Udemy, I was introduced to and incorporated features like Stacks, ScrollView, and NavigationView, alongside SF Symbols for aesthetic appeal. The SwiftUITrackableScrollView package sourced from GitHub enhanced app functionality. Stack Overflow aided in debugging processes and ChatGPT helped refine written descriptions.

Graphics were sourced from Canva's AI tools and Wikimedia Commons, optimized with photo compression and scaling software. The Xcode simulator facilitated app previewing and progress guidance. This comprehensive use of technologies ensured Trailblazer's development, allowing me to develop a platform that empowers female athletes.
